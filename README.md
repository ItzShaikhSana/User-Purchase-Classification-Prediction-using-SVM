# User-Purchase-Classification-Prediction-using-SVM
This project implements the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for predicting user purchase classification. It utilizes the user-data.csv dataset, which contains information about users and their purchase behavior. The goal is to train an SVM classifier to predict whether a user will purchase a particular product or not.
